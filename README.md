# MariHacks-Project-Max
It's in ALPHA STAGE!!!!!

With my basic knowledge of Python, the help of one of the mentors Robert Fratila, countless hours of searching stack overflow post, and two of my partners leaving, I created the first half of my desired program.

My Goal was to take an image + sound file, convert the sound file into binary. Then take that binary code and put it into a grid of pixels where 1’s are on (blue) and 0’s are off (black), and then through a Python code, overlay them together, making it a printable picture. Once printed out, a software/camera would then read the pixels on the picture and convert them back into binary and re-encoded into a MP3 format and play the original soundbite. And thus, you can carry around a picture of someone who is close to you with an audio file of him/her saying for example, “I love you”.

Basically, the first half was to create the Python software used to generate the desired image. The second half would have been a Android/IOS app that scans the image (that is printed) and extract the binary code out of the image and turn it into a MP3 file that would automatically play. 

The Issues I had, would be the color of the binary code file is off, it should be only black and white not black and blue, and trying to overlay two pictures over each other is presenting quite a challenge and should probably be reworked if used in different situations with more complex images.

This is in no way a finished product, rather a pitch for an idea while using my limited knowledge of Computer Programming
